# The production document (v47.6) — baseline audit and what changed

This note covers Stage A (the baseline audit of the existing pipeline) and the parts of Stages B to J of the production
protocol that are now in code. Every claim here can be checked against a file, a test, or a render listed below. What
is not done is said so, in section 5.

## 1. Baseline (Stage A): the pipeline as it was

The phone makes a film in one call chain:

`MainActivity.makeFilm` → `FilmJob.start` → `FilmJob.run`:

1. **Read.** `ScriptParser.parse` turns the script into a `Story`.
2. **Production plan (optional, online).** `ScriptAI.productionConference` (cloud) is applied by `ProductionPlan.apply`.
3. **Pictures.** `Art.fromManifest(cast.txt)` loads them.
4. **Plan.** `Director.prepare` / `Director.direct` produce the `Film`: parts, cameras, shots, keys, effects, weather and sounds.
5. **Checks and mix.** Lock sheets, the review ledger, `Mixer`, Human QC, `FinalQc`.
6. **Render.** `Renderer` → `FilmLook` / `Grade` → `VideoWriter` (MediaCodec) writes the film.
7. **Files kept with the film:** `qc.txt`, `edit_list.txt`.

The desktop tool `tools/jvm/MakeFilm` runs the same reader, director and renderer, writing through ffmpeg.

Gaps found:

- **No single document for a production.** The reader's facts, the director's plan and the reviews lived in separate places:
  - the Story and the Film in memory;
  - `review_ledger.json` and `qc.txt` as text.
- **Ids changed between runs.** `DirectorsManual.charIds` (CHAR_001…) is recomputed every time and never kept, so adding a character renumbers the others.
- **Unused declarations.** `Story.ShotDirective` / `Scene.approvedShotDirectives` are declared but never used.
- **Review records don't gate rendering.** `ReviewLedger` and `ReviewConference` exist, but nothing reads `readyToRender` before a film is made.
- **No explicit / inferred / unknown marking.** Nothing marked a fact as written by the user, read from context, or not known.
- **Environment not checked.** Nothing compared what the script asks of the environment with what the plan schedules. Several of आखिरी चिट्ठी's requirements were silently dropped (section 3).
- **Physics.** Nature effects are procedural: particles and mesh sway are computed directly from time; there is no time-stepped simulation. `EverydayPhysics` is not reachable from the renderer.

## 2. What is now in code

### `core/ProductionDocument.java` (new, offline, deterministic)

It is built from what the reader and the director already produce. It does not read the story a second way, and it
does not plan shots of its own.

**Stable ids**

- Ids are CHAR_001, PROP_001, LOC_001, SCENE_01, LINE_001, ACT_S2_005, ENV_S1_03, STATE_001, SHOT_S3_21, ISSUE_001 and FACT_0001.
- People, things and places get their ids once and keep them in `production_ids.txt` in the project. A prop inserted in the middle of the list never renumbers the others (tested).

**Facts (each EXPLICIT, INFERRED or UNKNOWN, with the words it came from)**

- **Characters:** age, height, weight, posture ("back bent 90°"), bare feet, and the look kind (INFERRED).
- **Props:** size, material, condition, colour, owner, the broken part, what it supports, the foot it is worn on and the bare foot, a wound, and the writing on it.
  - The owner is EXPLICIT when the name says whose it is. When it comes from what the dialogue calls someone ("दादाजी"), it is INFERRED with the reason.
- **Places:** what a place is in front of (with the distance in steps), what it is behind, and the main location.

**Dialogue**

- Exactly as written, in order, with the speaker id and the delivery note (never part of the line).

**Steps**

- The script's descriptions are read as atomic steps, split at commas, at clause-joining "और" and after each finished verb.
- The doer is chosen by the Hindi verb's gender when the named character does not agree. For example, "धीरे से खड़ी होती है रघुवीर जी की तरफ…" is परी's step.
- Negations ("बिना आवाज किए" → MUST_NOT) and conditions ("अगर वह दौड़ती…" → HYPOTHETICAL) are read but never staged.

**The environment as causes and effects**

- Each requirement is tagged with how the film carries it out:

  | Method | What it means |
  |---|---|
  | IN_BACKDROP_PICTURE | the place's picture already shows it |
  | PROCEDURAL_ANIMATION | animated by formula |
  | PARTICLE_SYSTEM | drawn as particles |
  | SOUND_EFFECT | carried by a sound |
  | UNSUPPORTED | no method in this renderer |

- For each requirement the document also records whether the director actually scheduled it.

**Thing states**

- Where each listed thing is and who holds it, part by part. This includes what a line says happened before ("found on the ground behind the postbox": told, not shown).

**Shots**

- The director's own shot list, with the scripted flag.

**Issue register (BLOCKER / MAJOR / MINOR / WARNING)**

The technical director's checks:

- a speaker for every line;
- every explicit requirement scheduled, or said to be unsupported;
- every step the plan should show is in it;
- a picture for every person and listed thing;
- never two holders of one thing at once;
- no shot shorter than 0.5 s.

**Reviews and render records**

- **Bound to a revision.** Every review is bound to the revision it read, and any change raises the revision.
- **Director's sign-off.** It is refused over an open BLOCKER, and refused without the technical director's validation of the same revision.
- **Render records.** A render is VERIFIED only when it was made from the approved revision, its file exists and it is at least 1 KB.
  - With no file, or an empty file, it is FAILED.
  - With a file but no approval, it is UNAPPROVED.
- **Completion.** `complete()` is true only for a verified render of the current revision.

### The director (`core/Director.java`)

| Change | Script words |
|---|---|
| Wind said other ways is wind | "हवा अब भी चल रही है", "गर्म हवा से धूल उड़ रही है", "कुर्ता हवा में हल्का हिल रहा है" |
| A negation counts only in its own clause | "एक भी बादल नहीं, … गर्म हवा चल रही है" (the wind is there; before, the whole sentence was negated) |
| A light wind stays light; later sentences raise it only if they say "strong" | "हल्की-हल्की गर्म हवा" |
| Dust motes drift in the light (new `W_MOTES`), distinct from the dust storm | "धूल के कण हवा में उड़ रहे हैं" |
| Moving sun patches (new `W_DAPPLE`) | "धूप के गोल धब्बे … हिल रहे हैं" |
| Sounds the description names: cycle bell, leaf rustle in the wind, distant running steps | — |
| The bench rocks as she sits on it (new `FX_WOBBLE`) | "बेंच थोड़ी सी हिलती है क्योंकि उसका एक पैर टूटा है" |
| A bag set down from the back lies beside her — unless it is part of the user's picture of her, where it stays on her back and a note says why (two bags would be worse) | — |

- **Bench wobble.** It is a damped rock drawn on the user's bench picture: 1.8°, 2.4 rocks a second, settling in about two seconds. It is a procedural approximation, not physics, and the sitters do not rock with the bench.
- **Moving sun patches.** These are drawn in screen space and are not cast by the tree in the picture.

### Where the document is used

- **Phone film job (`app/FilmJob.java`).** After the director's plan, the job:
  - builds the document, validates it, records the reader's review and the director's sign-off;
  - writes `production_document.json` and `production_ids.txt` with the project;
  - adds the report to `qc.txt`.
  - When the film file is saved, the job records the render against the revision. The verification goes into the JSON, into `qc.txt` and onto the film page's info line.
  - A refused sign-off is shown as a warning. The film is still made and recorded as UNAPPROVED, never as verified.
- **Studio page (`app/MainActivity.showStudio`).** A "Production check" under the director's plan shows the summary and the open issues of the live plan. Pictures are checked by the cards above it.
- **Desktop (`tools/jvm/MakeFilm`).** `PRODDOC=file.json` writes the document with the plan, then again with the render's verification.

### The cast of आखिरी चिट्ठी

`tools/testdata/aakhiri_chitthi/plan.txt` leaves out `pari_upload_17`:

- that sheet shows a toddler with buns on a bench of her own;
- its pieces had been read as kneeling poses;
- so परी knelt at the postbox as that child, sitting on a second bench.

## 3. आखिरी चिट्ठी, before and after (the director's plan, user's pictures, desktop)

| Requirement (script) | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Light hot wind, scene 1 from the start | from 14.9 s at 0.6 (the "बादल नहीं" in the sentence negated it) | from 7.7 s at 0.35 |
| Wind in scenes 2 and 3 | none in 2; 5 s at the end of 3 | the whole of both scenes |
| Dust motes (all scenes) | not scheduled | `W_MOTES` |
| Cycle bell, leaf rustle, distant running steps | not scheduled | scheduled |
| Moving sun patches (scene 3) | not scheduled | `W_DAPPLE` (approximation) |
| Bench rocks as परी sits | not scheduled | `FX_WOBBLE` at her sit (approximation) |
| परी kneeling at the postbox | drawn as an off-model toddler on a second bench | on model; see section 5 |

The production document for the film now reports:

- 2 characters, 13 props, 3 places, 3 scenes, 7 lines and 30 steps;
- 25 of 25 environment requirements are in the plan;
- 6 open issues and no blockers:
  - leaves sliding along the ground: UNSUPPORTED;
  - setting the bag down: it is part of परी's picture;
  - her hand on his hand: no gesture;
  - her head on his shoulder: no gesture;
  - two 0.41 s cuts during her run (the technical director's 15 % motion rule).

## 4. Tests (plain JVM, `tools/robotest`)

**`ProductionDocumentTest` (6 tests)**

- ids stay when a prop is inserted;
- an approval is bound to its revision;
- the director never signs off over an open blocker, and signs off once it is resolved;
- a render is done only with its file: missing or empty is FAILED, no approval is UNAPPROVED, and an older revision is not complete;
- negations and hypotheticals are read, not staged;
- the document is valid JSON.

**`AakhiriChitthiAcceptanceTest` (8 tests, the Section 15 fixture)**

- Counts: characters, props, places and scenes.
- The seven lines: compared with lines read straight from the file, not through the parser.
- The environment's causes, the unsupported requirement in the register, and the wobble scheduled.
- The footwear, the stoop, the broken leg and the brick, the inferred owner, and where the places are.
- परी's steps in order (RUN, GO_TO the postbox, PLACE the bag, KNEEL, REACH_INTO, TAKE_OUT the letter, STAND_UP, STEP_TOWARD him), the "बिना आवाज" negation, and his TAKE_FROM / her SIT_BESIDE.
- The letter's chain: narrated on the ground, then परी, then रघुवीर जी, never in two hands.
- The closing scripted pull-back to a wide.
- Missing character pictures asked for; a failed render never complete.

**Regression**

- The plan digest (posture, acts, effects, weather and sounds) of all 2,100 stories in the test data was compared, old code against new.
- 7 stories change, all intended:
  - the चिट्ठी scripts;
  - बाबू के लिए gains the cycle bell its script names;
  - one story gets dust motes while sweeping;
  - one gets leaf rustle;
  - one keeps its light wind.
- The comparison also caught a broken `else if` chain introduced during this round: "dust storm" stories had gained rain and thunder. It was fixed before this note.

## 5. Not done, or not right yet (said, not hidden)

- **Kneeling.** परी kneeling is in the plan, but her front picture has no leg rig (`legs=false`), so she is drawn standing.
- **Contact gestures.** Her hand on his hand and her head on his shoulder have no gesture in the rig. The document marks them UNSUPPORTED.
- **The bag.** The bag cannot be set down: it is part of परी's picture.
- **Leaves on the ground.** Leaves sliding along the ground have no method.
- **Bench wobble.** The wobble rocks the bench picture only, not the sitters.
- **रघुवीर जी seated.** Seated front-on, he still reads a little as standing in front of the bench.
- **Flash cuts.** The technical director's motion rule cuts परी's run into 0.4 s shots. It is reported as MINOR and not changed: the rule is the protocol's.
- **Visual checks.** Steps marked IN_PLAN are checked against the plan the renderer draws, not against rendered pixels. The frames listed in `docs/testing-v47.md` were looked at by eye.
- **Not built:**
  - no multi-agent conference runs offline (the cloud conference in `ScriptAI` is unchanged and needs the user's own key);
  - no 3D rigging, lip-sync or physics simulation was added;
  - nothing here should be read as a claim of studio-level output.

## 6. Second round (17 October, later): the two new scripts, the standard format, the editor

### The user's scripts in the fixed format

Both are saved verbatim as fixtures; no existing screenplay was overwritten:

- आखिरी जोड़ी: `tools/testdata/aakhiri_jodi/aakhiri_jodi_numbered.txt`
- आखिरी चाय: `tools/testdata/aakhiri_chai/aakhiri_chai_numbered.txt`

Reader fixes found by these scripts (in `ScriptParser`, for every story):

- **Endings.** "समाप्त - समय: शाम 6:30 बजे" and "END." are the end. The first had been read as a seventh line spoken by "समाप्त - समय".
- **Names with a dash.** A numbered name with a dash and its description on the next line ("एक नई लाल जूतों की जोड़ी - आखिरी जोड़ी") no longer switches the whole list to the older one-line reading. That reading had dropped "मोची का औजारों वाला बक्सा".
- **Note before the words.** `name: (note) "words"` no longer leaves a stray comma in the note.
- **Headings in parentheses.** A scene heading in parentheses ("(दृश्य 1 — …)") is read as a heading. A direction such as "(दृश्य बदलता है)" stays a direction.

The production document:

- **Dialogue notes.** The notes with each line are now read as the speaker's own steps: "(दौड़ती हुई आती है …)" is नन्ही running in.
- **Owner in brackets.** "काला छाता (मीरा का)" gives an explicit owner.
- **Scene times.** A scene heading's time ("[शाम 7:15]") and times with minutes ("6:30 बजे") are read.
- **New steps.** GIVE, OPEN (with "बक्सा नहीं खोलते" read as a negated step), DRINK, POUR and ARRIVE.
- **Shared environment table.** The environment is read by one shared table for every story (`ENV_RULES`): rain, rain stopping, lightning, clouds, fog, snow, steam, smoke, fire, embers, lights, flicker, reflections, shadows, drips, puddle rings, flowing or receding water, a fluttering prop, smells and the street's sounds. Each requirement is either carried out (and checked in the plan), said to be unsupported, or said not to be filmable. The matrix is in `docs/engineering/animation-renderer-research-2026-10-17.md`.

Director fixes found by आखिरी चाय (in `Director`, for every story):

- **Nobody falls because water or tea falls.** "पानी बाल्टी में गिरता है" had thrown मीरा to the ground, and "चाय की धार … गिर रही" had thrown रघु काका. Someone falling *into* water still falls.
- **Sitting near something is sitting.** "भट्टी के पास बैठा" is seated.
- **Late entrances.** "तभी आरव दौड़ता आता है" and "तभी मीरा आती है" are entrances: they are not on the stage from the scene's start.
- **More lightning words.** "जोरदार बिजली" is lightning.
- **More sounds.** A rickshaw's bell, splashing steps, horns far off and a bulb's hum are heard. "पानी उफन" is moving water.

The plan digest of all 2,100 test stories, compared before and after these changes: 4 stories change, all from the added sounds.

### The standard screenplay format (`core/ScreenplayFormat`)

`format(Story)` writes the script from the reader's own reading, never by replacing characters:

- a plain title;
- the numbered lists;
- "(दृश्य N — …)" headings;
- descriptions in parentheses;
- `name: "words" (how it is said)`;
- a plain "समाप्त" or "THE END".

`validateFormattedText` checks those rules line by line and names each line. `validate(Story)` checks the story itself: a title, non-empty scenes, and every speaker in the list. `formatScript` refuses to format, and returns nothing, when the formatted script would read back with a different scene, speaker or word.

| Check on all 2,100 test stories | Result |
|---|---|
| Same scenes, speakers and words after formatting | 2,100 of 2,100 |
| Formatted text passes the rules | 2,100 |
| Formatting a formatted script changes nothing | 2,099 (the exception is an emoticon ":-(" inside a description, which the reader itself rewrites) |

The Studio has a "📝 Script format" card with the format notes for the script as written. "Show it in the standard format" opens the formatted script. "Use this script" replaces it only on the user's tap, and keeps the earlier one as `script_before_format.txt`.

On the user's own scripts as written, the rules note:

- the bare "दृश्य 1" headings (the standard puts them in parentheses);
- the note before the words (the standard puts it after);
- the `[CAMERA …]` block in square brackets;
- "समाप्त - समय: …" (the ending is the word alone).

The film is made either way.

### The editor (`ProductionDocument.editorReview`)

The editor runs offline, the same for every story. It notes what a script leaves open and never settles it; the notes are WARNING-level and never block. On आखिरी चिट्ठी it flags the five questions the protocol names:

- how the letter came to lie behind the postbox (told, not shown);
- why it lay unfound through "पंद्रह साल";
- whether "बापू के लिए" is the outside or all of the letter;
- that "बेटे" / "मुन्ना" and his handwriting exist only in the lines;
- "तुम सच में परी हो" as wordplay on her name.

The line is kept as written.

### Tests (all plain JVM, all passing locally)

New this round:

- `NewFormatScriptsTest` (3)
- `ScreenplayFormatTest` (7)
- `AakhiriChitthiAcceptanceTest` (+1, the editor)

These were added to the CI test list locally; nothing was pushed.
